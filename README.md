# MNIST VAE using Tensorflow
Tensorflow Implementation of the Variational Autoencoder using the MNIST data set, first introduced in [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114). 

Encoder/decoder pairs can be any combination of the provided fully-connected or convolutional architectures. 

Plotting functionality is also included for visualising a 2-D latent space.

Implementation based on the two (immensely helpful) resources:

* Ilya Kostrikov's [vae-gan-draw](https://github.com/ikostrikov/TensorFlow-VAE-GAN-DRAW) repo.
* Fast Forward Labs' blog series, [Introducing Variational Autoencoders](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/12/introducing-variational-autoencoders-in-prose-and.html) and [Under the Hood of the Variational Autoencoder](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/22/under-the-hood-of-the-variational-autoencoder-in.html).
